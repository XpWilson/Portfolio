                <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Sneaky Sneaky was a university project in which I had to master Unityâ€™s built-in Navigation
                        system and learn how to use state machines.
                    
                    <p>The objective of the game is simple, clear past four short puzzles filled with guards patrolling
                        the area. Once you reach the end you win the game.


                    <p>The gameplay is rather simple, the player is controlled by a point and click system. The player
                        clicks in the direction they want to go and the avatar follows. The enemies, in this case, the
                        guards follow a predetermined path based on the blue spheres in the area. The Guards all have
                        six states. The patrol state is their default state, which is when all the guards are following
                        their predetermined path. The Idle state is denoted by their sudden darker color palette. This
                        indicates that the Guard has reached one of their patrol spots. They will pause for a few
                        seconds and then proceed to their next location back in the patrol state. The Reverse state is
                        self-explanatory, it reverses the path the Guards follow, the state is active when the Guard
                        appears blue. The pause state is also self-explanatory, the guard is paused mid-state and they
                        will not move until they are unpaused, paused guards appear grey. When the Guards hear the fire
                        alarm has been tampered with they will forget about their previous patrol path and go towards
                        the alarm to deactivate it. This is their Angry state, and once reaching the alarm they will go
                        back to their patrol state. The final state is the Pursue state, this is only activated when the
                        player character gets too close to a Guard. The Guard will chase the player until they are too
                        far out of range.

                     <p>The bulk of my excitement for this project was learning how to use the Navigation system in
                         Unity. All moving entities including the player are using the NavMesh system to move around the
                         game. Studying AI movements is a topic that fascinated me when first playing open-world games
                         with enemies roaming about. Was it as simple as moving an entity from point A to B or was there
                         more complexity to it? This project was my first taste of that world and I can not wait to use
                         systems like NavMesh more in future projects.

                        <h2>Features</h2>
                        <p>The base version of the game uses an inventory system, checkpoint system, objective system, player and camera controllers. One of the core action provided to the player is the use of the gravnull gun. The gravnnull gun allows the player to grab and launch objects. As level designers we were not allowed to edit these systems, instead we designed levels around these concepts.</p>
                        <p>In my version of SCRAPS, I used two main level mechanics: the activation of pressure plates and object-snapping. These mechanics are taught early on to serve them as a guide on how to complete the level. There are other systems I created such as destructible walls and cutscenes to deliver a more enjoyable experience.
